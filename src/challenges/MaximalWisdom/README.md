# Maximal Wisdom

## Task

On a distant planet called Zephyria, the inhabitants have the 
ability to communicate with trees. These trees, known as "Trees
of Knowledge", are ancient beings possessing vast knowledge of
the universe. Each Tree of Knowledge is represented by a binary
tree, where each node contains a unique piece of wisdom.

Given the array representation of a Tree of Knowledge, you are
asked to identify the level that has the largest sum of knowledge
and display that level. To do this, you must take into account
that the array representation of binary trees follows a special
structure that can be used to optimize your work.

The inhabitants of Zephyria believe that the level with the
greatest amount of knowledge is the most sacred and contains the
deepest and most valuable secrets in the universe. Therefore, it
is of utmost importance to discover that level and access its wisdom.

## Constraints

- 1 <= N <= 10^3

## Input Format

A single line array representation of a binary tree.

## Output Format

Sum of the level with the highest sum of wisdom.
